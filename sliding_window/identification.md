Two kinds of problems: (1) fixed size window OR (2) variable size window. Things to look for:

1. Given an Array/String
2. Asks to do something on a subarray or substring
3. Fixed sized window: given window size, do some computation for that window. Ex: find $k$ size window with sum $s$
4. Variable size window: given some conditions, compute the window size. Ex: find the smallest subarray/substring with sum $s$ etc.
